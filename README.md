### Hi there üëã

I am Jefferson Quesado. Refer to me just as Jeff if you may.

You may find me at GitLab as [@jefferson.quesado](https://gitlab.com/jefferson.quesado). Indeed I am more there than here...

I do open source:

- https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross#our-contributors
- https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/AUTHORS
- https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/totalcross-functional-toolbox
- https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/tc-http-conn
- https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/tc-compiler-help

I also share open knowledge that I learned while working for GeoSales:

- https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/mybatis-fragment-usage
- https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/spring-boot-docker-to-gitlab-registry

In 2020 I presented at TDC Sampa Online, [devops](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2020/sampaonline/trilha-devops). [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1056ZTER3doFThgPbU8NFxjiL8wNMTCdVo0dXOmu-63o/present), [Q/A](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2007798).

Grab yourself a cup of coffee ‚òï or tea üçµ and reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JeffQuesado).

### About code and me

So, I really love shell üêö scripting! I twice taught Bash, once at college and then at [CENAPAD-UFC](https://cenapad.ufc.br/).

Some Python üêç knowledge, but Ruby üíé got me by passion. My expertise is Java ‚òï

FP is so awesome that, some time after Java 8 provided us with some of it, I must implement it in a [TotalCross compatible way](https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/totalcross-functional-toolbox).

Also, expect from me ways to automatize things. Like, didn't found a perfectly suitable Docker image for Android/Flutter using Fastlane?
No problem, [I create my own](https://github.com/jeffque/fastlane-linux-flutter-android-dockerimage). Need to build a TotalCross executable
inspecting the classpath to see which jars to compile to a tcz? [Give me a predicate](https://gitlab.com/geosales-open-source/tc-compiler-help).
